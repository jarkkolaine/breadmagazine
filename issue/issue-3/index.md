The third issue of Bread Magazine explores the magical processes of fermentation: how those tiny cells of yeast and bacteria make a dough come to life — and how you can make the most of them in your baking.

## In this issue

-   A look at what happens in a dough’s life cycle before it goes into the oven.
-   An interview with Ying Shi, a talented home baker and a great example of how far deliberate practice will take you.
-   How you can use preferments to give more flavor and better structure to your bread — it’s not hard at all.
-   Step by step instructions for creating your own sourdough starter and then using it to bake great bread.
-   How the opinionated but friendly French baker Sebastien Boudet is building a sourdough revolution in the Nordic country of Sweden.
-   Troubleshooting a dough that is not rising or doesn’t produce the bread you had in mind.
-   Ideas for what to do with all the sourdough starter you can’t use for bread making.
-   An interview with Mike Zakowski, bread making world championship silver medalist and exceptional baker from the slow city of Sonoma Valley, California.
