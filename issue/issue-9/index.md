The art of milling flour. Gluten free baking. Wood-fired ovens. A baker's favorite tool.

We think about flour: visits to two mills, one in Finland and one in the U.K., a chat with a baker who mills his own flour, and an exploration in the world of gluten free baking make sure you get your hair covered in flour.
