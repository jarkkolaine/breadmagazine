title: Issue 12 - Passion of Bread

This issue combines many of our favorite things: presenting bakers from around the world (Australia, Germany, Indonesia), starting and running small bakeries, making a living doing what you love — and bread making experiments.

## In this issue

-   An exploration of the autolyse technique: its past, its present, and its usages in bread making.
-   What happens at the bakery when we are not looking?
-   One formula, six different flours. An experiment to find out what difference flour makes.
-   An introduction to bread in Germany.
-   Lutz Geißler’s 100% Rye Bread recipe.
-   A look into baker’s percentage in complex formulas.
-   Nurhasanah Johari shares her experiences in running a subscription based micro bakery, Woodlands Sourdough, in her home in Singapore.
