Bread relates people to each other. It speaks to the heart of our
relationships, and to our ties with nature, art, history, society, and
science. At the crossroads of home baking and professional craft&nbsp;baking, BREAD
Magazine is an instructive, entertaining and inspiring journey that fosters
meaning and deeper connections.

\*\*

BREAD Magazine was an independent magazine for bread lovers, made by bread
lovers. A magazine for people who love and make great bread &mdash; for anyone
who finds joy and fulfillment in the act of mixing a dough, the slow rhythm
of natural fermentation, and listening to the crackling sound that comes
from fresh loaves of bread as they cool in the quiet of the home kitchen
or the bakery.

As the name implied, the focus in the magazine _was_ strictly on bread: no
cakes, no pastry. No food other than bread. If that sounds like the
right kind of focus for you, maybe you are a bread lover just like we
are? In this case, BREAD is for you.

BREAD focuses on stories, biographies and narratives from the bakers,
farmers, and millers&rsquo; &mdash; and everyone else involved in bread
&mdash; own perspective. It also puts into question popular beliefs and
misconceived ideas by means of in-depth essays and technical
discussions, in order to contribute to a higher awareness and knowledge
of the issues that bread enthusiasts may encounter.

BREAD Magazine is distributed digitally _(and now, for free)_ as a beautiful,
hand-crafted (just like we enjoy our breads) PDF document that you can download from
this page.

We also have a few print copies of issue 21 laying around... if you would like
to have one, send us a note!
