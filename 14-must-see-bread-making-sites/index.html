    <p>Last week, we took a look into the book shelf to find <a href="https://bread-magazine.com/bread-making-books/">our favorite bread making books</a>. Big thanks for everyone who shared their own suggestions! I was reminded of many great books I haven’t read in a while as well as found new books to check out next.</p>

<p>This week, in that same spirit of sharing bread making resources, I thought it would be fun to look at the internet next.</p>

<p>So, today, here is my list of web sites I return to as often as possible, looking for inspiration and ideas, or just to have a good time around bread. As with books last week, I’m sure the list is far from complete and so I invite your contributions in the comments: if your favorite web site (it could even be your own site) isn’t listed, leave a comment and tell us why you like that site and why it should be included in our list of resources.</p>

<h3 id="the-web-sites">The Web Sites</h3>

<p>Without further ado, here’s my list of web sites to check out:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.thefreshloaf.com">The Fresh Loaf</a>:</strong> In many ways more than just one web site, <em>The Fresh Loaf</em> is the number one hangout for artisan bread lovers on the web. Its forums and blogs are a huge source for knowledge, growing bigger every day.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://sourdough.com">Sourdough Companion</a>:</strong> Similar to The Fresh Loaf, Sourdough Companion is a web forum and community for sourdough bakers of all skill levels. The site also maintains a database of artisan bakeries and bakery jobs from around the world.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.breadtopia.com/">Breadtopia</a>:</strong> Breadtopia is a bread making blog and a collection of bread making tutorials in both video and text. As the site has been around for a long time, it’s archives are a valuable resources for anyone looking to learn more about bread making.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.farine-mc.com">Farine MC</a></strong>: One of the big inspirations for BREAD, the Farine blog is filled with stories about bread and bakers as well as information and formulas to improve your bread making.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://litemer.paindemartin.se">Pain de Martin</a>:</strong> The most popular bread making blog from Sweden documents Martin Johansson’s experiments as he bakes and explores bread and through recipes, gives you the opportunity to learn with him. As a new addition, the blog now also has a podcast. If you understand Swedish, this blog is well worth following. You may also want to check out our interview with Martin in our <a href="https://bread-magazine.com/issue/december-2013/">December 2013 issue</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.myitaliansmorgasbord.com">Bread and Companatico</a>:</strong> This friendly and approachable blog documents the bread making experiments of Barbara Elisi, an Italian scientist living in Sweden. Barbara is passionate about bread and it shows clearly through the blog.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://stirthepots.com">Stir the Pots</a></strong>: The blog documents the many bread making experiments by one of the most prolific bread bakers I know of, Jeremy Shapiro. The New York chef bakes bread whenever he can and shares the results (as well as his other explorations around bread) on his blog. Jeremy’s collection of recorded interviews with other bakers is also worth exploring. Check out our <a href="https://bread-magazine.com/issue/february-2013/">February 2013</a> issue for an article about Jeremy’s experiments at running a micro bakery.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.wildyeastblog.com/">Wild Yeast Blog</a>:</strong> These days, Wild Yeast is probably best known for its YeastSpotting column that collects and showcases some of the most beautiful breads baked around the internet. But in addition to this, the blog’s archives are filled with a lot of useful and well-explained information about baking bread.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://girlmeetsrye.blogspot.com">Girl Meets Rye</a>:</strong> Girl Meets Rye and its sister blog <em>Tartine Bread Experiment</em> (to be honest, I am not quite sure if Tartine Bread Experiment was changed into Girl Meets Rye or if they are still updated side by side…) are bread making blogs filled with beautiful photography and great bread recipes and experiments.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://smokesignalsbaking.tumblr.com">Smoke Signals Baking</a>:</strong> The Smoke Signals Baking blog is more about the thinking and self-searching that goes on behind the scenes of building a bakery and living fully than actually baking bread. However, while it’s not as much a baking blog as the others listed on this page, it’s one of the most inspiring. We interviewed the baker behind the blog, Tara Jensen in our <a href="https://bread-magazine.com/issue/june-2013/">June 2013 issue</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.ploetzblog.de">Plötzblog</a></strong>: The best known bread making blog from Germany is a fountain of knowledge for anyone who can read the language (or knows how to use Google Translate).</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://brotdoc.com">Der Brotdoc</a>:</strong> Another great bread making blog from Germany filled with bread making formulas and advice.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.flourandwater.co.uk">Flour &amp; Water</a>:</strong> Flour &amp; Water is a book project built in the spirit of internet: chapters are published straight to the web site and then edited based on feedback from readers.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://clayoven.wordpress.com">The Clay Oven</a>:</strong> A blog about all things clay ovens. For the oven building enthusiasts (or anyone who would like to build one).</p>
