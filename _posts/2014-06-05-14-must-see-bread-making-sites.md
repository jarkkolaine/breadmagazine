          The Baking Academy of Ireland was established four years ago. It is located
          in a picturesque courtyard in Palmerstown Village, Dublin 20. The Academy is run
          by Master-baker Derek O'Brien. The team of expert and professional bakers at the
          Baking Academy offer a wide range of interesting, practical, educational and fun
          courses for lovers of all things associated with baking. The courses are designed
          for both the amateur and the accomplished baker.

          Not exactly a bread-making site, but related.  Pizzamaking.com is an awesome
          reference, and I have learned a lot about bread-making (like using baker's formulas)
          from the site.

          hi! wow, i just found this lovely site. thank you for this. more bread blogs to peruse.
          so, i'm the author of 'girl meets rye'. yes, tartine bread experiment was the first blog, several years old, but i realized i was doing more of my own bread than tartine's, so i decided to change the name of my blog. tartine will remain active, because there is so much information on it and i want people to have access to it. any further experiments will be posted on the new blog 'girl meets rye', with an 'heads up' announcement on tartine bread experiment so that the older followers know that there is a new experiment posted.
          i hope this clarifies. thank you for loving the site!

          G'day Jarkko, wonderful ideas and help at the same time. At home We are
          big on baking sourdough using various flour types but most often rye and spelt
          stone-ground flour. We use all sorts of recipes, from the large global baking
          community (Metric and Imperial and US measures), but always with our kept, nearly
          10 years old, sourdough culture. For flour volume/weight conversion I use this
          flour amounts converter http://www.traditionaloven.com/conversions_of_measures/flour_volume_weight.html
          which has pounds or ounces to kilograms or grams and it is a fantastic tool for
          exact measuring. Thank you for your lovely help to us bakers.

          Another new, but still great website is the http://betterbreadmaker.com/. It generally targets people using bread machines.
          They have some great bread making resources and reviews like how to make your loaf perfect and what to look for when purchasing a new bread machine.

          I attended both the Deutsch brot and Pain Francaise one day courses in January this year
          The courses were well attended professionally presented and good fun, suitable for both beginner and improver bakers.
          The lunch alone was worth the modest fee.
          I had struggled with sourdough before the course and on returning home I followed the sourdough instructions and am now into my faith Month with the same perpetual  sourdough. I would highly recommend the baking academy
          Thanks guys for a great experience

          Can I shamelessly self promote my own bread blog here? :P breadbarnone.wordpress.com
          is my collection of yeasted and sourdough breads, baked on a home scale but now
          also tending towards market-scale. I like to think that my recipes are worthy
          of a mention, and I hope that people enjoy them!

          It's because Susan is going after a law degree now, and likely has no time
          for the blog. So much good information available to us to use as I don't think
          she intends to remove the blog! So, not all is lost!

Last week, we took a look into the book shelf to find [our favorite bread making books](https://bread-magazine.com/bread-making-books/). Big thanks for everyone who shared their own suggestions! I was reminded of many great books I haven't read in a while as well as found new books to check out next.

This week, in that same spirit of sharing bread making resources, I thought it would be fun to look at the internet next.

So, today, here is my list of web sites I return to as often as possible, looking for inspiration and ideas, or just to have a good time around bread. As with books last week, I'm sure the list is far from complete and so I invite your contributions in the comments: if your favorite web site (it could even be your own site) isn't listed, leave a comment and tell us why you like that site and why it should be included in our list of resources.

### The Web Sites

Without further ado, here's my list of web sites to check out:

**[The Fresh Loaf](http://www.thefreshloaf.com):** In many ways more than just one web site, _The Fresh Loaf_ is the number one hangout for artisan bread lovers on the web. Its forums and blogs are a huge source for knowledge, growing bigger every day.

**[Sourdough Companion](http://sourdough.com):** Similar to The Fresh Loaf, Sourdough Companion is a web forum and community for sourdough bakers of all skill levels. The site also maintains a database of artisan bakeries and bakery jobs from around the world.

**[Breadtopia](http://www.breadtopia.com/):** Breadtopia is a bread making blog and a collection of bread making tutorials in both video and text. As the site has been around for a long time, it's archives are a valuable resources for anyone looking to learn more about bread making.

**[Farine MC](http://www.farine-mc.com)**: One of the big inspirations for BREAD, the Farine blog is filled with stories about bread and bakers as well as information and formulas to improve your bread making.

**[Pain de Martin](http://litemer.paindemartin.se):** The most popular bread making blog from Sweden documents Martin Johansson's experiments as he bakes and explores bread and through recipes, gives you the opportunity to learn with him. As a new addition, the blog now also has a podcast. If you understand Swedish, this blog is well worth following. You may also want to check out our interview with Martin in our [December 2013 issue](https://bread-magazine.com/issue/december-2013/).

**[Bread and Companatico](http://www.myitaliansmorgasbord.com):** This friendly and approachable blog documents the bread making experiments of Barbara Elisi, an Italian scientist living in Sweden. Barbara is passionate about bread and it shows clearly through the blog.

**[Stir the Pots](http://stirthepots.com)**: The blog documents the many bread making experiments by one of the most prolific bread bakers I know of, Jeremy Shapiro. The New York chef bakes bread whenever he can and shares the results (as well as his other explorations around bread) on his blog. Jeremy's collection of recorded interviews with other bakers is also worth exploring. Check out our [February 2013](https://bread-magazine.com/issue/february-2013/) issue for an article about Jeremy's experiments at running a micro bakery.

**[Wild Yeast Blog](http://www.wildyeastblog.com/):** These days, Wild Yeast is probably best known for its YeastSpotting column that collects and showcases some of the most beautiful breads baked around the internet. But in addition to this, the blog's archives are filled with a lot of useful and well-explained information about baking bread.

**[Girl Meets Rye](http://girlmeetsrye.blogspot.com):** Girl Meets Rye and its sister blog _Tartine Bread Experiment_ (to be honest, I am not quite sure if Tartine Bread Experiment was changed into Girl Meets Rye or if they are still updated side by side...) are bread making blogs filled with beautiful photography and great bread recipes and experiments.

**[Smoke Signals Baking](http://smokesignalsbaking.tumblr.com):** The Smoke Signals Baking blog is more about the thinking and self-searching that goes on behind the scenes of building a bakery and living fully than actually baking bread. However, while it's not as much a baking blog as the others listed on this page, it's one of the most inspiring. We interviewed the baker behind the blog, Tara Jensen in our [June 2013 issue](https://bread-magazine.com/issue/june-2013/).

**[Plötzblog](http://www.ploetzblog.de)**: The best known bread making blog from Germany is a fountain of knowledge for anyone who can read the language (or knows how to use Google Translate).

**[Der Brotdoc](http://brotdoc.com):** Another great bread making blog from Germany filled with bread making formulas and advice.

**[Flour & Water](http://www.flourandwater.co.uk):** Flour & Water is a book project built in the spirit of internet: chapters are published straight to the web site and then edited based on feedback from readers.

**[The Clay Oven](http://clayoven.wordpress.com):** A blog about all things clay ovens. For the oven building enthusiasts (or anyone who would like to build one).

And now... It's your turn. Explore the web and share your favorites in the comments below!
