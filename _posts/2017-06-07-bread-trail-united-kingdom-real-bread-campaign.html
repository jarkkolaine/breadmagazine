<p><a href="http://bread-magazine.com/article/bread-trail-sweden">Leaving Sweden in our camper van</a>, my family and I had now entered the United Kingdom, the world of Chorleywood-processed bread and of the <a href="https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Bread Campaign</a>, launched by Andrew Whitley in 2008.</p>

<p>We had driven continuously for a month, through Northern Europe, and had finally crossed into the United Kingdom at Dover, on our way to Ty&rsquo;r Eithin farm (Carmarthenshire, Wales), where Tony and Sue Matthews managed an organic farm that was part of <a href="http://www.bancorganics.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banc Organics</a>, a not-for-profit community supported food scheme. We had found them through WWOOF UK&mdash;World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms&mdash;which is a great opportunity to be fed and boarded while volunteering on a farm. Fortunately, Tony and Sue welcomed children on the farm.</p>
<p>The nomadic lifestyle aboard a camper van hadn't been ideal for baking. I was eager to settle down for a while, help out, and continue my learning about bread.</p>

<p>Our camper van&rsquo;s clutch broke just as we neared the top of a hill, near Gloucester. Already exhausted by the long road trip from Sweden to the United Kingdom, we halted for a week-long camping experience in a garage&rsquo;s parking lot. Every morning at McDonald&rsquo;s, we drank espresso and used the free wi-fi to search for a 1981 Bedford clutch.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of our days strolling along the River Severn, reading books at the library, and visiting tourist attractions (including a majestic cathedral).</p>
<p>A docked lighthouse boat, completely painted in red, served as a Buddhist meditation center. The abbot first saw the lighthouse in a vision, and then turned his vision into a beacon of spiritual teachings to offer to the world.</p>
<p>Alas, there were no artisan bakers to enlighten my palate during our Gloucester days! On our departure day, I changed gears full throttle and cheerfully shouted, &ldquo;Yee-haw&rdquo;!</p>
