<p>In 1928, Otto Frederick Rohwedder created a machine that would change the way we buy our bread &mdash; sliced and wrapped in plastic.</p>
<p>In the sixties, the trend continued as fermentation was replaced by machines pushing air in the dough through intensive beating. Bread factories greeted this as a&nbsp;step forward: bread making, once a time-consuming process, could now be completed much faster &mdash; and without relying on experienced bakers. Factory bread invaded our homes and the art of a slowly fermented, hand made loaf was almost forgotten.</p>
<p>Now, this is about to change.<br />

<p>I interviewed <strong>Chris Young</strong>, the coordinator of <a href="http://realbreadcampaign.org/">Real Bread Campaign</a>, an initiative dedicated to putting bread back to its rightful place at&nbsp;the dinner table. He talked about the campaign, his appreciation for bread, and shared interesting facts about bread and its place in history.</p>

<p><em><strong>Jarkko</strong>: How did the Real Bread campaign get started?</em></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: The Real Bread Campaign&nbsp;was the brainchild of <strong>Andrew Whitley</strong> who, as an organic artisan baker, has been highlighting since the mid-1970s the state of bread in Britain, and sharing with people how we can all help to make a positive difference.</p>
<p>He knew that in order to bring Real Bread back to the hearts of our local communities in significant numbers, a national organization was needed. This would bring together everyone who was sick of industrial loaves as a mutually-supportive network, sharing ideas and experience; championing positive steps in the right direction, and challenging legislation and other obstacles to the rise of Real Bread.</p>
<p>He brought this idea to the charity Sustain: the alliance for better food and farming, which, as a campaigning organization, was happy to take on the task.&nbsp;We launched the Campaign in November 2008 and the open-to-all membership scheme in September 2009.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jarkko</strong>: How did you get involved with the campaign yourself?</em></p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: My first attempt&nbsp;at bread making as a student resulted in a brick, which I still use as a doorstop. Thankfully, I tried again and soon&nbsp;got the hang of baking a basic loaf. I got more interested in 2004 when I found Dan Lepard's <a href="http://amzn.to/2ouwMgU">The Handmade Loaf</a>. It was the first bread book I'd seen that didn't just take one or two basic recipes made with instant yeast, then throw in a handful of herbs or cheese or just make a load of different shapes, then write "Contains over fifty recipes" on the cover.</p>
<p>Then in November 2008, I went on a course with Andrew Whitley at Schumacher College. Reading his book Bread Matters and listening to him talk about the issues and his proposed solutions literally made me say "How can I get involved?"</p>
<p>He told me he was about to launch the Campaign, so I signed up for the newsletter, which a few months later advertised a vacancy for a volunteer...</p>
