My late grandfather loved being surrounded by his children and grandchildren, and always attached a great deal of importance to family dinners. During the school holidays, my cousins, my brother and I used to spend weeks at our grandparents' house. Naziha, my grandmother &mdash; a cordon bleu chef &mdash; enjoyed preparing tasty and spicy dishes, and would never forget to put _khobz_ (bread) on the table.

"One of the greatest joys of my childhood as a Tunisian," said Yosra, my older cousin, "was to grab a piece from the hot bread that dad or grandpa had just bought from the bakery, and eat it. It was so tasty and it smelled so good, that I remember myself eating a whole baguette, before getting home."

Here's a family account of Tunisian bread varieties from the perspective of a typical North-African extended family.

Since my youngest age, I remember eating bread with my cousins, in my grandparents' house, whenever we were hungry. We would eat many pieces of bread, until we finish a whole baguette, before lunch.

Bread has always been an essential and valued part of the Tunisian diet. Tunisians have a variety of sauces like mouloukhiya, [bean sauce](http://www.cuisinedefarida.com/archives/2012/07/27/24783614.html) or [chakchouka](http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/tunisian-chakchouka-195474), that they eat with bread. In fact, bread in Tunisia has a long history dating back over thousands of years. The cultivation of cereals allowed Tunisia, to become a major Mediterranean power, wealthy and prosperous, nicknamed "Rome's bread basket" during the ancient times. The Tunisian people inherited and developed several varieties of bread since ancient times: _tabouna_, _mlawi_, _khobz ghaney_, _khozb zitoun_, _khobz abraj_.

The special place of bread in Tunisians' diet habits is due to economic factors especially poverty. In fact, before the Tunisian independence to the present day, very poor people who can't buy meat or vegetables, just eat bread and _harissa_ (a hot chili pepper paste).

In fact, my mother's family was poor and my grandfather struggled to support his large family of six children. So, he always bought a large quantity of baguettes since bread is very cheap and subsidized by the Tunisian State. Besides, it is very substantial, filling and brings a feeling of fullness.

"When I was a child, I used to eat a lot of bread," said Hayet, my mother, "because that was all what we had to eat, most of the times and it made me skip meals because I was satiate for hours."

That's why most of Tunisian mothers give their kids sandwiches as snacks so they won't feel hungry and weak. During our childhood, my brother and I used to take two sandwiches to school, for breaks.

"At school, the greatest moment was break time," said Moucharref, my younger chubby brother, "it was with joy and gluttony that I eat my cheese or tuna sandwich, lovingly prepared by my mother."

Even adults, when a bit puckish, make _harissa_ sandwiches to fill the between-meal gaps. The spicy _harissa_ with bread is a good mixture to stave off hunger.

_Tabouna_ is Tunisians' favorite and most ancient bread. It's my grandmother's specialty, who wakes up at dawn to prepare Tabouna, for breakfast. Tabouna is a traditional bread baked along the walls of a traditional terracotta oven, itself called _tabouna_. Made from flour, this bread has a round shape, fairly flattened. _Tabouna_ is mostly consumed in rural areas of Tunisia, however, during the holy month of Ramadan, most Tunisian people prefer _tabouna_ to the French baguette. This traditional bread dates from the Carthaginian era and is proved by a terracotta (representing the _tabouna_ oven) present at the Museum of Carthage.

Tunisians eat straight _tabouna_ with salads like [salata mishwiyya](http://globaltableadventure.com/recipe/tunisian-grilled-salad-with-tuna-salata-mishwiyya) (grilled salad) with tuna, with harissa or with grilled meat. Many traditional fast food restaurants use _tabouna_ to make sandwiches, which are very popular among Tunisian people. Ilhem, my childhood friend who usually goes on long car trips with her family, to various Tunisian areas, always buys _tabouna_ from sellers on the road.

"When I go on a trip with my family, we always buy _tabouna_ whenever we're hungry from sellers on the road," said Ilhem. "It's hot, delicious and very substantial."

_Mlawi_ is a delicious kind of crepe or galette, which can be found everywhere in Tunisia. It is a product prepared from fine semolina, flour, a lot of oil (olive or sunflower), warm water and salt. In each city, village or neighborhood, you can find many _mlawi_ restaurants. This bread went viral among the Tunisian people, because it smells really good, has a fine texture and tastes wonderful (since it contains a lot of oil). People often eat hot _mlawi_ from the oven, and spread it with _harissa_, cheese, tuna or merguez. In rural areas, Tunisians often eat _mlawi_ with _chakchouka_. Besides, _mlawi_ is students' and young people's favorite fast food.

"Every day, once classes are finished, we would always buy _mlawi_ with harissa and tuna, and eat it on our way home." said Yassine, my cousin. "It's cheap and very delicious. There are generally long queues in _mlawi_ restaurants, especially during the school year."

_Khobz ghaney_ is one of the most ancient Tunisian breads and peasants' favourite bread. My great-grandmother, a peasant woman, always used to cook _khobz ghaney_ for her meals.

"My grandmother always cooked a single type of Tunisian bread: _khobz ghaney_," said Hayet, my mother. "Actually, all peasants eat it along with _chakchouka_ for their meals."

_Khobz ghaney_ is prepared with fine semolina, oil, salt, sugar, yeast and warm water. It is thick, smooth and very mellow. It is easily chewed and swallowed, which makes people eat lots of it, without noticing. _khobz ghaney_ takes its name from the oven in which it is prepared, which is called _ghaney_. It's a terracotta oven, and Tunisians usually put small stones at its bottom. _Khobz ghaney_ has originated &mdash; and is most consumed &mdash; in rural areas.

One of the most loved bread is _khobz zitoun_, "olive bread". _Khobz zitoun_ is made of basic bread ingredients and has a lot of olives (green and black), onion and dry herbs. These extra ingredients give it a rich and aromatic flavor. Generally, people eat _khobz zitoun_ during the holy month of Ramadan because it wets the appetite along with salads.

My grandmother Naziha always recommends <em>khobz zitoun</em>. "_Khobz zitoun \_should always have its place on the table," she says, "especially during Ramadan when we \[Tunisians\] most prepare a variety of salads. Kids love \_khobz zitoun_ too and eat lots of it."

From salty bread we move on to _khobz abraj_ (also called _harcha_), which is sweet bread in the form of sandblasted galettes, prepared from medium semolina, water, olive oil, salt, butter and a lot of white sugar.

It is thick, very coarse and dry. This diamond-shaped bread is very appreciated by Tunisian people, who have it with black coffee or with milk. Some people, to make it sweeter, fill it with dates paste mixed with a pinch of cinnamon, of ground glove, some oil and jam. It is a very traditional bread which was much consumed before, then nowadays due to the advent of the refined pastry industry.

"In my childhood, _abraj_ was my favorite sweet dish and dessert," says Amel, my aunt, "since it was almost the only sweet thing to eat, back then."

With the advent of French colonizers in 1881, the French baguette was progressively introduced in the Tunisian society. Currently, Tunisian people consume the French baguette subsidized by the Tunisian state, more than any other type of bread. The French baguette, introduced at the colonization era, became a very important item of Tunisians' food habits. Most bakeries (if not all of them), supermarkets, and grocery store sell the French baguette.

However, there is still a strong local bread culture. Tunisians still consume traditional bread, not only occasionally but some of them do it regularly because traditional bread is healthier than the French Baguette which contains lots of sugar, salt and can cause many diseases (such as diabetes, high blood pressure).
