<p><b>5:00 am&mdash;</b>The oven automatically turns on with the dutch oven inside. My goal is to get up and put some bread in the oven for the family&mdash;this is after they complained yesterday that there was no fresh bread in the house.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>8:15 am&mdash;</b>(Didn&rsquo;t make it out of bed as planned.) After an overnight proof in the fridge, the bread gets put on parchment, scored, and goes into the hot dutch oven.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>8:50</b> <b>am&mdash;</b>Bread is out of the oven and is crackling&hellip; Great oven spring&hellip; I&rsquo;m happy&hellip; Daughter is happy, she has fresh bread!<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>9:00 am&mdash;</b>My schedule this week is crazy: sick child at home with a virus going on for four days, two house guests, a daughter who just moved back home after her year at university, three other kids coming in and out. There is never a dull moment, so unless I&rsquo;m planning a sale I never know when I&rsquo;ll be baking. I&rsquo;m going to make my multigrain-multiseed for an event that I will be attending this evening, with a delegation of nurses that came from Israel. Weighed out the seeds for my soaker (going to scale it). Didn&rsquo;t read the formula correctly.</p>
<p>Note to self: focus, especially when so harried! Starting over. Reweighed all the seeds and oats and poured boiling water over the mixture.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>9:10 am</b>&mdash;Mix flours, water, and starter for autolyse. Weigh salt and put on mixer. This is the best way for me not to forget to add the salt<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>9:30 am</b>&mdash;Hunger has taken over. It&rsquo;s time for a smoothie (organic greens, frozen fruit, chia seeds, hemp seeds, fresh ginger and turmeric).<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>9:50 am</b>&mdash;Add the salt, mix, add the soaker, put dough in container and give it a few stretches and folds with wet hands. Using your hands is the ultimate way to get to know your dough!</p>
