    Hi! I think the best way would be by getting in touch with Amy through http://amyhalloran.net.
    If that doesn't work, please send us a comment using the BREAD Magazine contact form and I'm also happy to send you one :)

<h3>Dear friends and fans of flour,</h3>
<p>I invite you to become Flour Ambassadors. Since you are reading this, I know you are already representing our unnamed country. Loaf by loaf, pie by pie, baking escorts flour back into the good graces of people who are doubting gluten.[note]Please note that I am not being flip about the real challenges people face with bread and wheat. Rather, I am addressing the tendency I see in America to huddle around food fears. I grew up as the food industry, fueled by nutritionism, nudged people to doubt eggs, fat and salt; now these foods are coming back into vogue, as is bread.[/note]</p>
<p>I invented this campaign to shine a light on the wonders of fresh stone-ground flour and help build regional grain economies. Like farmers&rsquo; markets, mills are the levers that growers need to put something new in the ground. Commodity systems set the stage for farmers, millers, and bakers&mdash;determining what seed varieties are grown, how they are sold, and how they are milled.</p>
<p>If eaters and bakers want more choices, like alternative grains, heritage grains, and stone milling, we have to support regional systems all the way back to the field.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://kneadingconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kneading Conference</a> in Skowhegan (Maine), in &nbsp;July 2016, two hundred people stood up and put their hands over their hearts to proclaim the Flour Ambassador Pledge. Now, I&rsquo;m inviting you to join the movement.</p>
<p>Together we can build an appetite for&mdash;and awareness of&mdash;flours that come from somewhere and someone.</p>
<p>Your Civil Servant in Grains,<br />
Amy Halloran</p>
<p>P.S. Please join me in tagging images with #flourambassador, and @flourambassador on social media. Name your farmer or mill, too.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>THE FLOUR AMBASSADOR PLEDGE</strong></h2>
<p>I do solemnly, happily swear,<br />
that I am going to tell everyone I see<br />
that it&rsquo;s okay to love flour!<br />
Bread is not poison,<br />
Invisibility is poison.<br />
I will try to make visible<br />
all the labor in bread,<br />
from seed to mill,<br />
from mill to loaf.<br />
Mills are the levers farmers need<br />
to get more interesting grains in the ground,<br />
and on our tables,<br />
and under our butter.<br />
Because butter is terrific and bread is our family tree,<br />
It is time to put the family pictures back in the album,<br />
put the album back on the mantelpiece,<br />
and get acquainted with grains and flour again.<br />
