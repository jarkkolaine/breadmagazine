<p><b>Wednesday evening</b>&mdash;It's late at night when I prepare my sweet starter/levain to be used in my 100% sourdough Danish pastry. Leave to ferment and double overnight on the kitchen counter.<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>Thursday morning</b>&mdash;I prepare the milky dough and put it in the fridge till late at night. Meanwhile I feed my good companion Rudl with 50% stone-ground wheat and 50% bread flour to keep him nice and strong. It&rsquo;s cold outside, so I warm a cup of water in the microwave, then put the fed starter into it. After he reaches his peak, I make two <i>levains</i>, one again sweet that I&rsquo;ll use in my 100% hamburger buns and the other one with 100% stone-ground wheat flour that I&rsquo;ll use the next day for bread.</p>
