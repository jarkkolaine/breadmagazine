Dear friends and fans of flour,

I invite you to become Flour Ambassadors. Since you are reading this, I know you are already representing our unnamed country. Loaf by loaf, pie by pie, baking escorts flour back into the good graces of people who are doubting gluten.

_(Please note that I am not being flip about the real challenges people face with bread and wheat. Rather, I am addressing the tendency I see in America to huddle around food fears. I grew up as the food industry, fueled by nutritionism, nudged people to doubt eggs, fat and salt; now these foods are coming back into vogue, as is bread.)_

I invented this campaign to shine a light on the wonders of fresh stone-ground flour and help build regional grain economies. Like farmers' markets, mills are the levers that growers need to put something new in the ground. Commodity systems set the stage for farmers, millers, and bakers&mdash;determining what seed varieties are grown, how they are sold, and how they are milled.

If eaters and bakers want more choices, like alternative grains, heritage grains, and stone milling, we have to support regional systems all the way back to the field.

At [The Kneading Conference](http://kneadingconference.com/) in Skowhegan (Maine), in July 2016, two hundred people stood up and put their hands over their hearts to proclaim the Flour Ambassador Pledge. Now, I'm inviting you to join the movement.

Together we can build an appetite for&mdash;and awareness of&mdash;flours that come from somewhere and someone.

Your Civil Servant in Grains,

_Amy Halloran_

P.S. Please join me in tagging images with #flourambassador, and @flourambassador on social media. Name your farmer or mill, too.
