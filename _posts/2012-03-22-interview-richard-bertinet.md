Together with his wife Jo, Richard Bertinet runs [The Bertinet Kitchen](http://www.thebertinetkitchen.com),
a cookery school in the historic city of Bath, England where his bread making classes are fully
booked for months in advance -- thanks to his best-selling books, [Dough](http://amzn.to/2oHVeZK)
and [Crust](http://amzn.to/2namJh7) which have been translated into many languages. Richard has been a
big inspiration for my baking, so I was honored to interview him for our first issue. We talked about bread,
baking, and a bit about going from home baker to doing it for a living.

_**Jarkko**: In your book, Dough, you say that you have been
crazy for bread ever since you were a child. Can you share a bit of the
story of how you became a baker?_

**Richard**: I think it started with going to the bakery every day.

Today, we see bread as a kind of pleasure, but on those days when I
was young, you could never sit down at the table in my house without a piece of
bread. So, I used to go to the bakery every morning, on the way back from
school.

The back door was slightly open, and I could see the young bakers work. There was something
fascinating about that. The T-shirts covered with flour, and that pride in their eyes.
Every time they looked through the door, they saw customers looking at them, and you could see that kind of a gleam
in their eyes &mdash; the pride of being a baker. And one day, I found myself behind
that door, working there. That's when I understood what it meant. When I put my
foot through that door, it was too late; I could never come back. I was
about thirteen-fourteen, and I knew school wasn't for me. I had to do something
with my hands. So I started working &mdash; this was before apprenticeship. I did two
weeks at school, and then two weeks at work, but I also worked after school and
every weekend. In the early age, you learn very quickly to behave yourself and
to respect &mdash; and to work hard. By the time I did my apprenticeship, I knew the
job. I was running the oven by myself when I was fifteen-sixteen.

_**Jarkko**: That's impressive! You were a real baker already at that age._

**Richard**: I knew the basics. When a new person is starting, he
tries to show off anyway, working harder and harder. It's a psychological war:
you can never tell anybody that you don't know your job, so you work harder to
prove that you can do it.

_**Jarkko**: How about today, do you think a route like this to becoming a baker would still be possible in France?_

**Richard**: I think the bakery industry is much more
regulated now; you can't work the hours you used to do twenty, thirty years ago.
But there are some small bakeries where they still work the old style, so if you
are young and ambitious, and you want to work hard, I'm sure it's possible. When
you grow up, you always think that when you were in your days, everything was
better.

When I was young, I remember the old people saying "well in my days it
was better." (laughs) So, I think it's evolution, you know. We do things in
different ways, we adapt. Everything changes.

But I think the thing with bread is that it's still
three or four ingredients. The skill of the baker is still quite primitive and
something you work with your hands. You get to create something from nothing,
and that is &mdash; with all the machines in the world &mdash; the real skill of a
baker.

It's something you practice; it's something you refine with years. The more I
teach, the more I learn about the dough: the way it feels, the way it behaves. I
always describe it a bit like making pottery. If you get some clay to make a
nice pottery, in the beginning, you will be a disaster. The more you work with
it, the more you understand the material you're working with, and the better you
become. Same as painting. The experience of a craftsman develops over years and
years and years. You can give a kilo of flour to ten different bakers, and they
will make something unique, each one of them. And that's the beauty of the job.
