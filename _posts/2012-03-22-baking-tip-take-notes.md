![Some of my early notes](/assets/blog/bread-1-notes.jpg)

In my bookshelf, right next to all the baking books, I have a collection of
small notebooks, full of notes of my bread-making experiments.

At different steps in the process, I write down any changes I make to the
recipe, whether planned or accidental. Things such as "Some trouble getting
the baguettes in the oven — maybe a peel of a different shape could
help?" or "Yet another sourdough experiment. The recipe is otherwise the
same as last time, except that this time I used 711 grams of starter at 100%
hydration..."

Then, when the bread is ready, I take some photos, taste the bread, and
write down my impressions. This way, by combining the results of the bake
with information on what I did differently during the process, I can learn
about the effects these changes have to the bread I'm baking.

Sometimes the recipe works out, and on those events, I will come back to the
recipe over and over again to make the same bread that I know I have enjoyed
in the past.

If you have just started your journey into bread — or if you haven't
picked the habit of writing notes about your bakes — this is one habit
I recommend you adopt as soon as you can. Get yourself an empty notebook,
open the first page, and start writing.

Start with the date and time, followed by a short note on which recipe
you're making (with information on where the recipe can be found). Then,
keep the notebook and a pen near as you bake and write down thoughts and
impressions as they come to your mind. If you are in the middle of working
the dough, it might be a good idea to try to keep your thoughts in your mind
until your hands are clean again!

There are also some other useful things that you can write down for later
analysis if you have time, such as the room temperature, the temperatures of
the ingredients, and the humidity of the room in which you bake.

At the end of your bake, write down a summary of whether the recipe was a
success or not.

Once you have gotten started with the habit of taking notes, don't forget to
review your notes from time to time. They will prove to be an invaluable
resource for improving your baking skills as well as a nice diary
documenting your journey.
