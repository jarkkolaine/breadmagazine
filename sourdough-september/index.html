<p>If you ask any member or fan of UK’s <a href="http://realbreadcampaign.org/">Real Bread Campaign</a>, September is the month of sourdough – and therefore one of the most exciting months of the year. It’s Sourdough September!</p>

<p>Sourdough September is such a great idea that I think everyone should join it, no matter where in the world you are at. Here are some ideas on how you can do it.</p>

<p>Here’s how the campaign explains Sourdough September on <a href="http://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/sourdough_september/">the event’s web site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ninth month of the year is when the Real Bread Campaign goes on a mission to help everyone discover that: life’s sweeter with sourdough!</p>

  <p>From 1-30 September, Real Bread bakers everywhere organise their own local events and activities to help share sourdough secrets and demystify the delicious delights of the oldest way of raising a loaf.</p>

  <p>Across thirty days of sharing food, facts and fun, Real Bread bakeries, baking schools, mills and food festivals around the UK and beyond will be running sourdough classes, tastings, feasts and more to help everyone experience and enjoy the power of sour.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="lets-join-the-fun">Let’s join the fun!</h3>

<p>The Real Bread Campaign is a UK initiative and therefore most of the Sourdough September fun happens on the British isles, but I see no reason why the rest of us couldn’t join the fun too!</p>

<p>So, wherever in the world you are, I challenge you to join the fun and make this September a month of spreading the joy of sourdough and bread making.</p>

<p>For some more introduction, <a href="http://blog.bakerybits.co.uk/sourdough-september-guest-post-from-chris-young-of-the-real-bread-campaign/">check out this blog post by campaign coordinator Chris Young</a> and then…</p>

<p>…here are <em>nine ideas to make your September full of sourdough, bread… and fun</em>!</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Support your sourdough baker</strong>: For the month of September, make it your mission to find and buy real sourdough bread made by small bakeries in (or near) your neighborhood. Keep track and see how many you can find!</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://bread-magazine.com/sourdough-starter-tutorial/">Create a sourdough starter</a></strong>: If you have been thinking of giving sourdough baking a try but have never done it, Sourdough September is a great time to finally get to work.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://bread-magazine.com/sourdough-bread-recipe/">Bake some sourdough bread</a></strong>: Bake, bake, bake. And if someone (your spouse for example) tells you to slow down, you have a good excuse: “I have to bake bread… It’s Sourdough September!”</li>
  <li><strong>Throw a sourdough party</strong>: If organizing parties is your thing, mix some dough, bake some bread and invite some friends over to enjoy fresh bread and maybe even bake some together. When it’s time to end the night, give each of your guests a small pot of your sourdough starter to take home with them.</li>
  <li><strong>Volunteer to teach a bread making class</strong>: If you like to teach, get in touch with your nearby school to see if they would be interested in having you teach the kids some bread making. Then make your preparations and get ready for a big fun mess with dough and children all over the place.</li>
  <li><strong>Surprise your neighbors</strong>: Ring someone’s door bell and bring your neighbor some fresh sourdough bread. While at it, you might want to tell them that it’s Sourdough September and that you just wanted to come and say hi. When I’ve done this, no one has turned down a loaf of bread yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Invite people to your bakery</strong>: If you are a professional baker, open your doors for one day and invite your customers to take a good look at what real sourdough bread making looks like. Give them samples and explain why making bread this way is different (and better) than the quick factory method.</li>
  <li><strong>Try something new</strong>: If you’ve never made 100% sour rye bread, or if you always make your sweet treats using yeast, there is no better time to experiment than Sourdough September. Do some research, pick a new recipe, and give it a try.</li>
  <li><strong>Write about Sourdough September</strong>: I’d love to see all of the internet buzzing about Sourdough September, with people getting curious and maybe even the traditional media picking the story and talking about it. To make that happen, the first step is to write about the event. Write a blog post about Sourdough September. Propose an article to a local newspaper. Share your favorite sourdough recipe on Facebook.</li>
</ol>

<p>And now, I’d like to hear your ideas! How will you be making great memories this Sourdough September?</p>
